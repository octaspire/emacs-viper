Configuration file for running GNU Emacs with
Vi(per) keybindings, usable and nice without
any external packages.

If wanted, it is possible to allow installation
of two useful packages: magit and slime. But this
is not done by default.

To manage these dotfiles using GNU stow:

#+begin_src shell
cd emacs-viper
make stow
#+end_src

This will create symbolic links to user's home directory.

Some keybindings are:

| KEY         | TYPE  | ACTION                                            |
|-------------+-------+---------------------------------------------------|
| ~M-/~       |       | Expand (complete) anything with ~hippie-expand~   |
| ~C-c SPC~   |       | Clear ORG table cell with ~org-table-blank-field~ |
| ~g<motion>~ | VIPER | Search the thing that vi motion chooses           |
| ~backspace~ | VIPER | Fixed in term-mode's char submode by advicing     |
