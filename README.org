Configuration file for running GNU Emacs with
Vi(per) keybindings, usable and nice without
any external packages.

If wanted, it is possible to allow installation
of two useful packages: magit and slime. But this
is not done by default.

To manage these dotfiles using GNU stow:

#+begin_src shell
cd emacs-viper
make stow
#+end_src

This will create symbolic links to user's home directory,
and append small snippet of shell script in the end of
~$HOME/.bashrc~, if it isn't already there. This should
bring the value of PATH variable to Emacs in macOS, if
Emacs is started using shortcut (without
exec-patch-from-shell package).
